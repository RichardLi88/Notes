## Correctness and Security
- developers are concerned with correctness
	- software operates as intended, achieving desired behaviour
- Security is concerned with preventing undesired behaviour
	- considers an enemy/opponent/hacker/adversary who is maliciously trying to circumvent any protective measures you put in place

## Undesired  Behaviour
- Stealing information
	- corporate secrets
	- personal information
- Modifying information or functionality (integrity)
	- destroying records
	- installing unwanted software
- Denying access
	- Unable to access a website, database, cloud drive

## CIA Triad

- Confidentiality
	- Information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities, or processes
- Integrity
	- software maintains and assures the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle
- Availability
	- Information must be available when it is needed

## What is software
- Software is a program consists of data and instructions that manipulate the data
	- Operating Systems
	- Stand-alone applications
	- Web applications
		- Server-side
		- Client-side
	- Mobile applications
	- Embedded Software
	- Software components
		- Libraries

## Common Terms
#### Threat
- a potentially dangerous event that, if occurs, breaches a desirable security property of a system
#### Attacker
- A malicious entity with a motive to realise a threat on a system 
#### Vulnerability
- A weakness in a system is exploitable by an attacker to realise a threat

## Why is Software Security a Problem?
#### Many vulnerabilities are being exploited
Strong incentives for finding and exploiting vulnerabilities
- Financial 
- Political/Espionage
#### Large numbers of software vulnerabilities are being discovered
Made worse by increasing software
- Complexity (millions of lines of code)
- Connectivity (more potential threats, zero-day vulnerabilities)
- Extendibility (online updates)


## Attackers, who are they?
- Criminals seeking gain or hiding criminal activities
- Insiders (employees) seeking revenge or financial gains
- also named, adversary
	- will work to find a bug and exploit it to achieve their goals
	

## Harms 
- Loss of productivity
- Loss of trust
- Loss of money
