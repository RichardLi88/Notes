## Why Study Data Representation?
- all data must be represented inside a computer in some form, so data representation is an unavoidable problem
- Designing computer hardware

- Developing software
	- making software portable across different machines is a common expectation and without understanding representation this is difficult to do

## Memory Addressing
- Every unit in memory has a unique address
