#### Two main sorts of arithmetic circuits of interest here
- Adders 
	- should take two inputs, give two outputs, sum and carry
- Shifters
	- allow one word to be left or right shifted by some number of bits
	- shifters are useful for multiplying by 2 or dividing by 2, and are an essential part of the multiplication algorithm
	- left shifting by 1 place multiplies the number by 2
	- right shifting by 1 divides the number by 2

#### How do we subtract numbers?
$$
A - B =
$$
$$
A + -B =
$$
$$
A + \overline B+1 =
$$
## Uses for multiplexers
- multiplexers can be used to impleemnt a wide range of devices
	- multiplexing of many sources
	- bus connections
	- complex min term expressions
- A Bus can take the value of anumber of signals, but must represent only one at a time
