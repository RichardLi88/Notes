#### Two main sorts of arithmetic circuits of interest here
- Adders 
	- should take two inputs, give two outputs, sum and carry
- Shifters
	- allow one word to be left or right shifted by some number of bits
	- shifters are useful for multiplying by 2 or dividing by 2, and are an essential part of the multiplication algorithm
	- left shifting by 1 place multiplies the number by 2
	- right shifting by 1 divides the number by 2

#### How do we subtract numbers?
$$
A - B =
$$
$$
A + -B =
$$
$$
A + \overline B+1 =
$$
## Uses for multiplexers
- multiplexers can be used to impleemnt a wide range of devices
	- multiplexing of many sources
	- bus connections
	- complex min term expressions
- A Bus can take the value of anumber of signals, but must represent only one at a time


## Equality Comparators
- equality comparators produce a signal if the two words are equal

## Magnitude Comparators
- MSI chips are available for comparing the relative size of two words
	- emit less than ,equal to and greater than signals
	- circuits compare bit by bit accountinf for the positions of the MSB and LSB in each of tghe words being compared

## Putting it all together

## Sequential Logic
- must be capable of retaining state information, ie it must "remember"
- This is typically achieved by internal feedback connections inside logic devices
- Basic building block in sequential logic is the latch or flip-flop
- THe simplest latch is the Reset-Set (R-S) latch
- The most commonly used latch is the D-latch
- An N-bit register contains N latches
- The terms "flip-flop" and "latch" are often used interchangeably
#### The SR latch or flipflop
![[Pasted image 20250316214203.png]]
- cannot use 1 1 input in S R latch
- It is possible to build a SR latch using only NAND gates
#### Clocked SR latch

#### D Flip-flop
- often we want to store a data signal rathter than a separate set and reset signal
- A D-type latch stores the value of its data input when the clock is strobed

## Edge Triggered devices
- often we want ot save some data when an edge changes rather than when the clock is high
- edge triggered flip flops are like clocked D-types, except the signal is stored when the clock signal goes from low to high or from high to low (negative edge triggered)
- a clock signal an be generated by a delay system


## Memory
- flip flops are the building blocks for memory units
- Memory chips need
	- a data interface
	- an address interface
	- a control interface
