## Three basic logical operations
#### AND
- denoted by a dot
#### OR
- denoted by a plus
#### NOT
- denoted by an overbar, single quote mark or tilde


## Truth Tables 
- tabular listing of the values of a function for all possible combinations of values on its arguments


## Using switches
#### For inputs
- logic 1 is switch closed
- logic 0 is switch open

#### For output
- logic 1 is light on
- logic 0 is light off


## Logic gates
- in earliest computers switches were opened and closed by magnetic fields produced by energizing coils in relays. 
- Later, vacuum tubes that open and close current paths electronically replaced relays
- Today, transistors are sued as electronic switches that open and close current paths

#### Gate Delay
- in actual physical gates, if one or more input changes causes the output to change, the output change does not occur instantaneously
- The delay between an input change(s) and the resulting output change is the gate delay denoted by t$_g$
